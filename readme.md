# Olymp
My collection of algorithms, data structures and tools for competetive programming

Most of the code is written in C++ for it's efficiency and great standard template library.

Almost every code in this library has to be used with `template.cpp` in front of it. <br>
Template file is regularly updated, most updates are backwards compatible.
